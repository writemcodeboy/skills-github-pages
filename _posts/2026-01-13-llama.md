Sunrise over the turquoise mountains
Messenger birds in sight
They came up through the valley
Both sides at a time
Through the cold steady rain
Raid!
I bend down
Poke a double decker on a llama, Taboot
Llama, Taboot Taboot
Trigger a blastoplast, ramshackle laker recedes
I start to run
It was the loudest thing I'd ever heard
And I knew my time had come
To enter the delta

Leave it on press, 
Depress, depress
Llama taboot

Leave it on press, 
Depress, depress
Llama taboot 
x6

Llama taboot taboot
Llama taboot taboot
Taboot taboot
Taboot
